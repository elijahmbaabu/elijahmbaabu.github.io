                     <p>I'm a computer science 2023 graduate of Dedan Kimathi University. 
                     A coompetent enterprise and individual software developer and an expert technical writer.
                     I'm a native english speaking African currently residing in Kenya. I have carried out various research projects
                    and worked on them till compeltion with them till completion. I have undisputed expertise in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Java and Python. 
                     I'm a problem solving business oriented individual with a lot of skills in business operation.<br><br>
                     
                     Finally, I'm always open to improvements and can work with anybody under all circumstances. 
                     When working, there is always room for corrections. During my free ime I like trying out 
                     new technologies and reading cybersecurity article with latest updates and patches.<br><br> 

                     Being located at an African country, a developing one, life is not eay and therefore 
                     being a smart students and finding your way out is th better option to make it in life. 
                     Following this, I have been in freelancing indusry during my scholing years up to now working with platforms such as <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/s/DaK7bo">Fiverr</a> and <a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~015c481bdd9a7a9558?viewMode=1">Upwork</a>.
                     This has given me a lot of experience in working, colaborating and relating with the people.
                     This has also instilled various characters and values in that I work on projects 
                     as if they are my own personal projects. </p>

                        I am a highly experienced programmer and designer, working together to provide top notch IT solutions to my customers. I have set very high standards for my work quality and aim to provide a professional but friendly environment to my customers, so that they feel right at home while doing projects with me.
